DESCRIPTION

The program 'mauires' generates a HTML-table out of the output from
'showres -n' in the Maui Scheduler.  Job reservations are always shown
on top of any possible user reservation.

Standing reservations can be recognized by name and shown in a
different color. Currently, user reservations named "devel*" is
recognized.

The output consists of a table with gif-images in various sizes
showing all the reservations made, both running and idle, giving a
good overview of the load on the system. CSS is used to prettify the
output.

The output is preferably combined with the output from 'showq' in a
perl-script creating a WWW-page showing a more complete status of the
system.  The enclosed file 'ingvarstatus' is such a script. For
a live demonstration, please direct your WWW browser to
