Maui 3.3.1
  - Fixed issue where hostlist was being overwritten resulting in broken $PBS_NODEFILE. (Alexis Cousein)
  - Fixed issue where users could set system priority on their own jobs. (Bas van der Vlies)
  - Made showgrid's, and other's, arguments case-insensitive. (David Chin)
  - Added build system changes to support Cygwin (Yauheni Charniauski, UIIP Minsk)
  - Added the --with-cygrunsrv configure option for start maui as Windows service (doesn't use a background daemon).
    Cygwin utility cygrunsrv.exe goes it into background independently (Igor Ilyenko, UIIP Minsk)
  - changed all remaining mallocs to callocs which zeros memory on allocation.  Fixes a crash due 
    to the way some whiel loops in MResAdjustDRes() expect things to be. (Jason Williams)
  - Added proper memory allocation checks to accompany the callocs in MRes.c to avoid
    missing memory errors. (Jason Williams)
  - Added debug print messages to MUSNPrintF() and added a proper check of the return
    code to vsnprintf to be in accordance with glibc >=2.1, if installed. (Jason Williams)
  - Changed top-level Makefile BUILDROOT assignment to allow RPM builds (Jason Williams)
  - Minor changes to fix a few valgrind errors about uninitialized values (Jason Williams)
  - Patch to fix SYSTEMMAXJOBWALLTIME, SYSTEMMAXPROCPERJOB, and SYSTEMMAXPROCSECONDPERJOB
    which previously no-op'ed (Jason Williams)
  - Patch for 'showq -r' to show the correct values between 0 - 100 percent if NODEALLOCMAXPS is set
    to TRUE (Bas van der Vlies)
  - Added UseMachineSpeedForFS patch. (Robin Roth)
    "When using Fairshare it weights the Fairshareusage with the speed of 
    the nodes used by the job. Up to now the nodespeed is only used to allow 
    jobs to run longer, but with fairshare users on slower nodes are punished, 
    as their fs-usage is higher than on fast nodes. Additionally this allows 
    single nodes to be taken out of the fairshare-system by setting their speed 
    to very low numbers."

Maui 3.3
  - Fixed configure script. Was putting RMCFG[name] TYPE=PBS@RMNMHOST@.

Maui 3.2.6p21
  - Added RMCFG[] ASYNCJOBSTART=TRUE for asynchronous job starts in pbs. (Thanks to Bas van der Vlies and the community)
  - Added StartTime and CompletionTime to Gold Charge.
  - Fixed backfill issue with SINGLEUSER NODEACCESSPOLICY. (Thanks goes to Roy Dragseth)
  - N->{A|C}Res.Swap is overcommitted with N->CRes.Swap instead of N->CRes.Mem. (Thanks goes to Roy Dragseth)
  - Fixed a nodes configured swap from changing in a maui+pbs setup. (Thanks goes to Gareth Williams of CSIRO)
  - Fixed CHECKSUM authentication for maui + slurm. Thanks goes to Eyegene Ryabinkin.
  - Fixed 64bit issue. Maui assumed ints were always 8 bytes for 64bit systems even though x86_64 ints are still 4 bytes. This lead to aliasing of large indexed node properties to smaller indexed properties. Maui now triggers off of sizeof(int). Thanks goes to Alexis Cousein.
  - Fixed an optimiztion issue with x86_64 systems. -O2 was optimizing out parts of the communication strings.

Maui 3.2.6p20
  - Fixed a potential security issue when Maui is used with some PBS configurations.
  - Fixed a bug pertaining to Maui's resource policy ExtendedViolation time (thanks goes to Nick Sonneveld).
  - Fixed a bug with generic consumable floating resources which prevented them from working when a job also requested a 'mem' resource (thanks to Jeffrey Reed for the fix).
  - Fixed typos in MPBSI.c that may have caused undesirable side-effects (thanks to Jeffrey Reed for the fix).
  - Fixed a bug where group fairshare components were being miscalculated when percent based fairshare is enabled (thanks goes to Steve Traylen for the fix).
  - Implemented FSSECONDARYGROUPS to map unix groups to fair share groups. Contributed by Bas van der Vlies (SARA).
  - Implemented IGNPBSGROUPLIST to ignore 'qsub -W group_list=<value>'. Contributed by Bas van der Vlies (SARA).
  - Note for FSSECONDARYGROUPS and IGNPBSGROUPLIST:
    {{{ 
      Maui did not parse the PBS group_list parameter:
        qsub -W group_list=<value>

      This variable has the highest priority and will set the group credential to
        the value specified. We at SARA want to ignore this parameter, because we
      do not want an user to specify its own group and bypass the FairShare
      targets. So we added an option to ignore this parameter:
        - IGNPBSGROUPLIST          TRUE

      This patch also fix some debug problems that i had when the debug level is
      set to another value then the default one, eg:
        - LOGLEVEL 9

      Maui has a lot of keywords and the parsing of the keywords are only be
      shown if a certain loglevel is set. Somebody thought it is nice that the
      maui keyword table is sorted alphabetically. This is not correct because
      now only the keywords after the LOG... definitions are shown. This patch
      moves the LOG.. keywords definition to the beginning of keyword table and
      fix this problem.
    }}}

  - Implemented fitting of jobs into available partitions. Contributed by Eygene Ryabinkin, Russian Research Centre "Kurchatov Institute".
    ex. USERCFG[user] PLIST=par1,par2,par3 PDEF=par2 user's job will firt try to be fit in par2. If par2 doesn't work then par1 and par3 will be tried. 
  - Added DBG(3,fALL) to lone DPrint statements in src/moab/MRes.c because it was flooding the log file for Michael Barnes when working with 32k jobs.

Maui 3.2.6p19

  - Implemented fixes for a segfault, FSPOLICY loading, and workload traces submitted by Ake Sandgren
  - Implemented patch in MJobProcessExtensionString to avoid dropping first token (from Peter Gardfj√§ll)
